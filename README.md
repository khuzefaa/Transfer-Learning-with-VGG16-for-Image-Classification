# Transfer-Learning-with-VGG16-for-Image-Classification
provides a comprehensive introduction to transfer learning using a pretrained VGG16 model for image classification. It covers the fundamental concepts of transfer learning, including its benefits, such as reduced training time and the ability to work with smaller datasets.
he project includes a practical case study that demonstrates feature extraction using the VGG16 model to classify images from the TensorFlow cats_vs_dogs dataset. The implementation includes data preprocessing, model setup, training, evaluation, and visualization of results. Additionally, it addresses overfitting by incorporating dropout layers and fine-tuning the model with a lower learning rate. The code is written in Python using TensorFlow and Keras, with detailed explanations and visualizations to aid understanding.This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (2025_07_25.ipynb) that explores transfer learning concepts and implements a case study for classifying cat and dog images using a pretrained VGG16 model. The notebook is structured to guide users through the theory and practical application of transfer learning, including feature extraction, model evaluation, and techniques to mitigate overfitting
